    "  - Determine if one thing causes another.\n",
    "  - Estimate the magnitude of the causal effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Potential Outcomes: Notation\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition**: \n",
    "  - $T$: Observed treatment (e.g., taking a pill: $T=1$ or not taking a pill: $T=0$).\n",
    "  - $Y$: Observed outcome (e.g., headache or no headache).\n",
    "  - $i$: Subscript denotes a specific individual.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Potential Outcomes**:\n",
    "  - $Y_i(1)$: Outcome if the treatment is applied ($T = 1$).\n",
    "  - $Y_i(0)$: Outcome if the treatment is not applied ($T = 0$).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Relationships:\n",
    "1. If $T = 1$, then:\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   Y_i \\mid \\text{do}(T = 1) \\triangleq Y_i(1)\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   - Example: Treatment (taking a pill) leads to no headache.\n",
    "2. If $T = 0$, then:\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   Y_i \\mid \\text{do}(T = 0) \\triangleq Y_i(0)\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   - Example: No treatment (not taking a pill) results in a headache.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Causal Effect:\n",
    "- The **causal effect** for an individual is:\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  Y_i(1) - Y_i(0)\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  - This measures the difference in outcomes between receiving treatment ($T=1$) and not receiving treatment ($T=0$).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Potential Outcomes: Key Concept\n",
    "- **Definition**:\n",
    "  - Potential outcomes represent what would happen under two scenarios: with or without treatment.\n",
    "  - Notation:\n",
    "    - $Y_i(1)$: Outcome if treatment is applied (e.g., taking a pill).\n",
    "    - $Y_i(0)$: Outcome if treatment is not applied.\n",
    "  - **Causal Effect**: $Y_i(1) - Y_i(0)$\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Intuition**:\n",
    "  - If $Y_i(1) \\neq Y_i(0)$, the treatment has a causal effect.\n",
    "  - Example: If taking a pill cures a headache ($Y_i(1) = 0$) and not taking it doesnâ€™t ($Y_i(0) = 1$), the pill has a causal effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Fundamental Problem of Causal Inference\n",
    "- **Issue**:\n",
    "  - You can only observe one outcome for an individual:\n",
    "    - If treatment is applied, $Y_i(1)$ is observed, and $Y_i(0)$ is a counterfactual.\n",
    "    - If treatment is not applied, $Y_i(0)$ is observed, and $Y_i(1)$ is a counterfactual.\n",
    "  - This makes it impossible to compute the causal effect $Y_i(1) - Y_i(0)$ directly.\n",
    "- **Solution**:\n",
    "  - Use averages across groups to estimate the **Average Treatment Effect (ATE)**:\n",
