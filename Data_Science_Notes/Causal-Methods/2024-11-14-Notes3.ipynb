    "\n",
    "### The Key Assumption: Ignorability\n",
    "- **Definition:** The potential outcomes $Y_i(1)$ and $Y_i(0)$ are both **independent** of treatment $T$:\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  (Y_i(1), Y_i(0)) \\perp T\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "- **Implication:** If ignorability holds, the **average treatment effect (ATE)** is equal to the **associational difference**:\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  \\mathbb{E}[Y_i(1) - Y_i(0)] = \\mathbb{E}[Y | T = 1] - \\mathbb{E}[Y | T = 0]\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mathematical Derivation\n",
    "1. Starting with the ATE:\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   \\mathbb{E}[Y_i(1)] - \\mathbb{E}[Y_i(0)]\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "2. Under **ignorability**, we can condition on treatment:\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   \\mathbb{E}[Y_i(1) | T = 1] - \\mathbb{E}[Y_i(0) | T = 0]\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "3. By the definition of conditional expectation:\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   \\mathbb{E}[Y_i(1) | T = 1] = \\mathbb{E}[Y | T = 1]\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   \\mathbb{E}[Y_i(0) | T = 0] = \\mathbb{E}[Y | T = 0]\n",

    "   $$\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why \"Ignorability\"?\n",
    "- Ignorability means we can **ignore** missing potential outcomes (i.e., the question marks in our data) and compute averages directly from observed outcomes:\n",
    "  - $\\mathbb{E}[Y | T = 1]$ for treated individuals.\n",
    "  - $\\mathbb{E}[Y | T = 0]$ for untreated individuals.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Graphical Interpretation of Ignorability\n",
    "- In a causal graph:\n",
    "  - **Confounding present:** Covariates $X$ influence both treatment $T$ and outcome $Y$.\n",
    "  - **Ignorability achieved:** If the edge from $X \\to T$ (treatment assignment mechanism) is removed, confounding disappears.\n",

    "### Exchangeability: An Alternative Perspective\n",
    "- **Definition:** Exchangeability means the treatment and control groups are **interchangeable** in terms of expected outcomes.\n",
    "- Example:\n",
    "  - Group $A$: Treatment group ($T = 1$), with $\\mathbb{E}[Y | T = 1] = \\mathbb{E}[Y_i(1)]$.\n",
    "  - Group $B$: Control group ($T = 0$), with $\\mathbb{E}[Y | T = 0] = \\mathbb{E}[Y_i(0)]$.\n",
    "- **Exchangeability:** Swapping treatment assignment between groups $A$ and $B$ does not change the expected outcomes:\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  \\mathbb{E}[Y_i(1) | T = 1] = \\mathbb{E}[Y_i(1) | T = 0]\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  $$\n",

    "  - The **conditional average treatment effect** is the expected difference in potential outcomes conditioned on $X$:\n",

    "    $$\n",
    "- **Derivation of CATE:**\n",
    "  1. Start with the difference in expectations:\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "     \\mathbb{E}[Y(1) - Y(0) | X] = \\mathbb{E}[Y(1) | X] - \\mathbb{E}[Y(0) | X]\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "  2. Apply **conditional exchangeability**:\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "     \\mathbb{E}[Y(1) | X] = \\mathbb{E}[Y(1) | T = 1, X]\n",
    "     $$\n",

    "### Definition of Positivity\n",
    "- **Positivity Assumption:** For any covariate values $X$ that occur with non-zero probability in the population, the probability of receiving treatment must be strictly greater than 0 and less than 1:\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  0 < P(T = 1 \\,|\\, X=x) < 1\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "- **Interpretation:** Every subgroup defined by $X$ must have some individuals in both the treatment group ($T=1$) and the control group ($T=0$).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mathematical Justification\n",
    "- Consider the **adjustment formula**:\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  \\mathbb{E}[Y(1) - Y(0)] = \\sum_X \\Big( \\mathbb{E}[Y \\,|\\, T = 1, X] P(X \\,|\\, T = 1) - \\mathbb{E}[Y \\,|\\, T = 0, X] P(X \\,|\\, T = 0) \\Big)\n",

    "  $$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Intuition Behind Positivity\n",
    "- **Causal Effect in Subsets:**\n",
    "  - If a subset of the population (e.g., $X=x$) contains only treated individuals ($T=1$) or only controls ($T=0$), we cannot estimate the causal effect in that subset because there is no comparison group.\n",
    "  - For example:\n",
    "    - If all individuals with $X=x$ are untreated, how can we estimate the effect of treatment for that subgroup?\n",

    "1. **Complete Violation:**\n",
    "   - If $P(T = 1 \\,|\\, X=x) = 1$ or $P(T = 0 \\,|\\, X=x) = 1$, we have a severe positivity violation.\n",
    "2. **Overlap and Common Support:**\n",

    "  - The distributions of $P(X \\,|\\, T=1)$ and $P(X \\,|\\, T=0)$ are entirely separate.\n",

    "  - The overlap between $P(X \\,|\\, T=1)$ and $P(X \\,|\\, T=0)$ diminishes exponentially.\n",
    "  - This phenomenon is known as the **curse of dimensionality**.\n",
    "- **Trade-off Between Unconfoundedness and Positivity:**\n",

    "### Practical Consequences of Positivity Violations\n",
    "- **Adjustment Formula:** Becomes undefined in regions with positivity violations.\n",
